# HOW DOES THE INTERNET WORK ? (summarized)

    WHAT's  INTERNET ?
    The Internet is a global network of computing devices (devices that can be 
    run a program, such as mobile phones,tablests desktops) that communicate with each other, being able to send and receive data.
     It is powered by many layers of protocols,
    that define how each device should be cominiable.


    HOW DID IT COME ABOUT?

    The history of the Internet begins during the Cold War (1945-1991) where the two super powers involved, the United States and soviet union, were divided into the capitalist and socialist blocs (respectively), disputed political and cultural powers.
    In order to facilitate the exchange of information because they feared attacks by the Soviets, the U.S. Department of Defense (ARPA) created a system for sharing information between geographically distant people in order to facilitate war strategies.
     At this moment, the prototype of the first internet network, Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)   appears.
    Thus, on October 29, 1969, the first connection was established between the University of California and the  Stanford Research Institute. It was a historic moment once the first email was sent.
    Since 1993, the Internet has ceased to be an institution of an academic-only nature and has been commercially exploited, both for the construction of new backbones by private companies (PSI, UUnet, Sprint,...) and for the provision of various services, which is open worldwide.

    TYPES OF NETWORKS:

    •LAN- is the most common type, this network covers a limited area such as a home or school.
    •WAN- is a network that spans a large geographic area and is composed of many, many LANs. Often, networks on a WAN can only be connected by renting telecommunications lines from different companies, since no company has all the infrastructure in the entire wide geographic area.
    •DCN- Data Center network a network used in data centers where data should be exchanged with very little delay.  

      HOW DOES IT WORK ?

       It is inconceivable to most people that no single group or organization controls this vast worldwide network. The truth is that there is no centralized management for the Internet.
      Rather, it is a gathering of thousands of individual networks and organizations, each of which is managed and supported by its own user. Each network collaborates with other networks to direct Internet traffic so that information can travel through them.
      Together, all these networks and organizations form the connected world of the Internet. For networks and computers to cooperate in this way, however, there needs to be general agreement on such things as Internet procedures and standards for protocols. These procedures and standards are found in RFCs (requests for comment) that users and organizations agree on. 


     IN ORDER FOR AN INTERNET NETWORK TO WORK, YOU NEED:

      Wired and Wireless: Physical connections between devices, as well as protocols for converting electromagnetic signals into binary data.
      IP: A protocol that uniquely identifies devices using IP addresses and provides a routing strategy for sending data to a destination IP address.
      TCP/UDP: Protocols that can carry data packets from one device to another and check for errors along the way.
      TLS: A secure protocol for sending data encrypted so attackers cannot view private information.
      HTTP & DNS: The protocols that power the World Wide Web, which the browser uses every time you load a web page.
